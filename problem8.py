8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
"""


"""
Answer....
Eggs is a valid variable name because taking a variable that have alphabets, underscore is fine.
We can also have numbers in variable names but it should not start with number but it can have
numbers afterwards.

100 is not a valid variable name because it starts with number which is not allowed in python.
