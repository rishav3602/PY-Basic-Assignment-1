Answer....

The three different data types are as follows:-

1. Integer - All numbers from 'minus infinity to plus infinity' falls under the category.

2. String - Whatever we put inverted commas are called as string. We can use either single or
            double inverted commas for single line string and triple inverted commas for 
            multi line strings.

3. Float - Any number that is in the form of the decimal like 45.6, 7.98 are known as float.
